# Hashinclude Front-End Development Task 

This is a simple Vue.js project that utilizes Vue.js via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). It serves as a starting point for developing web applications without needing to set up a local development environment. Here I use Vue.js 2.7.14 .

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Download The Project From GitHub :**

   https://github.com/Alan-1999-joy/hash-include-task

2. **Open `index.html` in your favorite code editor or directly in a web browser.**

   This project does not require a development server as it uses Vue.js via a CDN.

## Project Structure

The project structure is quite simple:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads Vue.js via a CDN and includes other Vue components.

- `components/`: This folder contains all the Vue compoents.

- `style.css`: Contains basic CSS styles for the project.

- `media.css`: Contains basic media queries.
